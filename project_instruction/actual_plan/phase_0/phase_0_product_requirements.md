# Phase 0 Product Requirements Document: Foundation & Environment Setup

  

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** 2025-07-31

**Owner:** product-manager

**Status:** Approved for Implementation

  

## Executive Summary

  

### Business Context

Phase 0 establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Case Management System, a legal/administrative workflow platform serving three distinct user roles: Clerk (case creation), Chair (oversight and approval), and Caseworker (case processing). This phase creates the technical foundation that enables rapid, quality-focused development in subsequent phases.

  

### Business Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** Establish a production-ready development environment that supports continuous deployment and automated quality assurance

- **Secondary Goal:** Validate end-to-end technical architecture through a functional "Hello World" implementation

- **Strategic Goal:** Implement the three core team principles (Peer Review, Data-Driven Decisions, Definition of Done) through automated tooling

  

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |

|--------|--------|-------------------|

| Environment Setup Time | <4 hours per developer | Time from clone to running application |

| CI/CD Pipeline Success Rate | 95%+ | GitHub Actions pass rate |

| Code Review Compliance | 100% | All PRs require approval before merge |

| End-to-End Test Coverage | Basic connectivity validated | Frontend → Backend → Database → n8n |

| Developer Environment Consistency | 100% | All environments produce identical results |
