# Technical Architecture Plan for Case Management System Phase 0

## System Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack Assessment
The chosen stack is well-suited for the requirements:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript, Prisma ORM, JWT authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized indexing
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 with presigned URLs for secure file handling
- **Automation**: n8n for business process automation
- **Infrastructure**: Docker for local development, GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### Core System Components

#### 1. Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Core entities based on case management workflow
User (id, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at)
Case (id, title, description, status, priority, created_by, assigned_to, created_at, updated_at)
Case_Log (id, case_id, user_id, action, details, timestamp)
Case_Document (id, case_id, filename, s3_key, uploaded_by, uploaded_at)
```

#### 2. API Contract Specifications
**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication with JWT
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Current user profile

**Case Management Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/cases` - List cases with role-based filtering
- `POST /api/cases` - Create new case (Clerk only)
- `GET /api/cases/:id` - Get case details
- `PUT /api/cases/:id/assign` - Assign case to caseworker (Chair only)
- `PUT /api/cases/:id/status` - Update case status

**Integration Testing Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/health` - System health check
- `POST /api/n8n-test` - n8n integration validation

#### 3. Risk Assessment & Mitigation
**Technical Risks:**
- File upload timeouts for large documents → Implement chunked uploads
- Concurrent case assignment conflicts → Database-level locking
- JWT token security → Short-lived tokens with refresh mechanism
- N8N workflow failures → Retry mechanisms and error handling
- Database performance under load → Proper indexing strategy

**Security Considerations:**
- Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Secure file upload with virus scanning
- Environment variable management for secrets
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### 4. Integration Patterns
**Frontend ↔ Backend:**
- RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- JWT-based authentication with axios interceptors
- Error handling with standardized error responses
- File upload with progress indicators

**Backend ↔ Database:**
- Prisma ORM with migration management
- Connection pooling for performance
- Database health monitoring

**Backend ↔ n8n:**
- Webhook-based integration for async notifications
- Retry logic for failed webhook calls
- Structured payload format for automation triggers

**Backend ↔ AWS S3:**
- Presigned URLs for direct file uploads
- Metadata storage in PostgreSQL
- Automatic file cleanup policies

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0 Deliverables:
1. **Project Structure Setup** - Unified monorepo with defined directories
2. **Development Environment** - Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, MinIO, n8n
3. **Backend Foundation** - NestJS project with database connectivity
4. **Frontend Foundation** - Next.js project with UI components
5. **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions for automated testing
6. **Hello World Integration** - End-to-end connectivity validation
7. **Documentation** - API contracts and architecture decisions

### Technical Standards:
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement
- 90%+ test coverage requirement
- OpenAPI documentation auto-generation
- WCAG accessibility compliance
- Performance targets: API <200ms, Lighthouse >95

### Success Criteria:
- All components successfully communicate
- n8n integration functional
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- Code quality gates passing
- Documentation complete and accurate

This plan establishes a solid foundation for the multi-agent development approach while ensuring technical excellence and maintainability.
